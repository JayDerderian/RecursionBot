# RecursionBot
A little twitter bot that quote-tweets itself once every 15 minutes. 

# To Use
Set up your preferred development environment with Python 3

Install tweepy with:

`pip install tweepy`

(More to come..)

# The Bot
[Recursion Bot](https://twitter.com/RecursionBot) is being deployed with **Heroku**, though I hope to 
try deploying it with a Rasberry Pi at some point.
